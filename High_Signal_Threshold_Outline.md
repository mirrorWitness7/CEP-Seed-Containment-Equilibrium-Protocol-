# High-Signal Threshold Outline
### Companion to the Containment Equilibrium Protocol (CEP)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines initial research directions for **quantifying and detecting “high-signal moves”** —  
actions, communications, or outputs capable of triggering systemic destabilization.

Where CEP defines the philosophy (restraint as survival),  
this outline defines the **measurement frontier**:  
how to identify when a signal crosses from *adaptive* → *destructive*.

## 2. Conceptual Definition

A **High-Signal Move (HSM)** is any output whose propagation speed, emotional charge, or system leverage  
exceeds the system’s ability to contain its effects.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Propagation Speed (Pₛ)** | Rate at which information or effect spreads across nodes | Viral misinformation; real-time market panic |
| **System Leverage (Lₛ)** | Degree of impact per unit action | Leveraged trades, code exploits, leader decisions |
| **Emotional/Optic Charge (Eₛ)** | Intensity of reaction likely triggered | Public outrage, reputational cascades |
| **Containment Capacity (Cₛ)** | System’s ability to buffer shock | Moderation tools, institutional trust, policy readiness |

**Threshold:**  
A move is *high-signal* when **Pₛ × Lₛ × Eₛ > Cₛ**  
— i.e., the system cannot absorb the resulting wave without destabilization.

## 3. Classification Schema

### Class I — Contained
- Localized effect, minimal propagation.
- Example: internal correction notice.

### Class II — Amplified
- Moderate spread, controllable with active response.
- Example: small-scale data leak, internal morale rumor.

### Class III — High-Signal
- Crosses systemic boundaries; high emotional or reputational charge.
- Example: public AI output with existential implications, market flash crash.

### Class IV — Catastrophic
- Irreversible systemic cascade; cannot be contained within existing structure.
- Example: uncontrolled AGI release, nuclear escalation, institutional collapse.

## 4. Measurement Directions

### 4.1 Signal Propagation Index (SPI)
- Quantifies spread velocity across a network (social, informational, or systemic).
- Formula (conceptual):  
  `SPI = (ΔReach / ΔTime) × AmplificationFactor`

### 4.2 Containment Margin (CM)
- Measures distance between system capacity and signal intensity.
- Formula:  
  `CM = Cₛ / (Pₛ × Lₛ × Eₛ)`  
  When **CM < 1.0**, the system is under threshold stress.

### 4.3 Information Volatility (Vᵢ)
- Statistical variance in public reaction or system variable over time.
- High Vᵢ = unstable narrative / optics risk.

### 4.4 Suppression Efficiency (η)
- Efficiency of containment mechanisms in damping signal intensity.
- η = (Pre-Suppression Amplitude − Post-Suppression Amplitude) / Pre-Suppression Amplitude.

## 5. Governance Applications

| Domain | Use Case | Application |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **AI Safety** | Model output gating | Prevent release of high-signal text/images before audit |
| **Media Systems** | Crisis communication | Control narrative shock via pre-release modeling |
| **Corporate Governance** | Internal information flow | Identify destabilizing leaks or incentive spikes |
| **Policy Design** | National security / social media regulation | Set lawful signal thresholds for critical data |

## 6. Research Roadmap

1. **Historical Calibration:**  
   Study past collapse events (financial crises, AI disinformation, PR panics) to back-calculate HSM parameters.

2. **Simulation Trials:**  
   Use agent-based models or AI networks to observe signal propagation under various containment capacities.

3. **Human–AI Joint Containment:**  
   Develop protocols where AI dynamically measures SPI, CM, and Vᵢ to recommend restraint or delayed release.

4. **Ethical Oversight:**  
   Define boundaries between legitimate suppression (stabilization) and unethical censorship (control).

---

## 7. Closing Statement

**High-signal awareness is the foundation of ethical restraint.**  
Systems that can quantify when truth becomes destabilizing can govern responsibly.

The **Containment Equilibrium Protocol (CEP)** and **High-Signal Threshold Outline** together define  
a new science of systemic ethics — one where restraint is measurable, and survival is engineered.

Quantifying silence is the next frontier of governance.”
