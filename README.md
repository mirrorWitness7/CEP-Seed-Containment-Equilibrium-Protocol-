# Containment Equilibrium Protocol (CEP) â€“ Seed Framework

## Overview
The **Containment Equilibrium Protocol (CEP)** proposes a new type of equilibrium where actors optimize for **system survival (Smin)** rather than payoff maximization or coordination.  

Stability emerges when all actors deliberately suppress **high-signal moves** that could trigger catastrophic collapse. CEP is a proactive restraint protocol.

## Core Concept

### Distinction from Other Equilibria
- **Nash (Pmax):** Optimize for payoff.  
- **Schelling (C):** Optimize for coordination.  
- **CEP (Smin):** Optimize for survival through restraint.  

---

## Governance Principle
> **Collapse is signal, not failure. Containment is survival.**

High-signal moves are suppressed to preserve system integrity. Containment provides a shield, allowing re-stabilization before irreversible collapse occurs.

---

## Case Studies
- **Cold War (MAD):** Mutual suppression of the ultimate high-signal move (nuclear launch).  
- **Corporate White-Glove Audits:** Contained disclosure prevents panic.  
- **Intelligence Operations:** Withholding critical information until secure channels exist.  

---

## Research Agenda
- **High-Signal Definition:** Develop criteria to identify and measure high-signal outputs.  
- **AI Safety:** Apply CEP to AI outputs that could trigger systemic risk.  
- **Human-AI CEP:** Explore protocols where humans and AI jointly suppress destabilizing moves.

---

## Positioning
CEP is a **seed framework** that:
- Expands equilibrium theory into fragile-system governance.
- Suggests practical applications for AI and institutional safety.
- Provides a foundation for testing, validation, and refinement.
